# Assortment Optimization for MMNL and NL Choice Models

This repository provides a Python framework for solving assortment optimization problems under two popular discrete choice models: the **Mixed Multinomial Logit (MMNL)** and **Nested Logit (NL)** choice models.  

The goal of assortment optimization is to select the subset of products to offer to customers to maximize expected revenue. This project provides tools to generate synthetic data, compute revenue, and find optimal assortments using both heuristic and exact optimization algorithms. The code is designed for **reproducibility, extensibility, and comparability**.

## üî± What's in there ?
### 1. Data Generation
Here summarizes the available data generation methods provided in  
`generator/`. 

The following is the data generation method of the MMNL model, you can import all generators as:
```bash
from generator.mmnl_data_generator import *
```

| Function| Description |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `mmnl_data_v0_lognorm` | **Our constructed** data generator designed to capture continuous heterogeneity among customer segments. A few segments exhibit exceptionall high no-purchase utilities `v0`, following a log-normal distribution. And there are various product revenue curves.|
| `mmnl_data_random`     | Randomly generates related data, where the no-purchase utility takes values 1 or 5 for half if the segments.  |
| `mmnl_data_easy`       | Following the setting used in [≈ûen et al.(2018)](#≈ûen2018). Produces uniformly random utilities and prices, with equal segment weights and no-purchase utility. | 
| `mmnl_data_hard`       | Following the setting used in [≈ûen et al.(2018)](#≈ûen2018). Generates a sparse utility matrix, where each customer type includes only k products with utility greater than 0 and the number of customer types equals the number of products.| 

The following is the data generation method of the NL model, you can import all generators as:
```bash
from generator.nl_data_generator import *
```

| Function| Description |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `nested_data_complex`   | Following the setting used in [Davis et al.(2014)](#Davis2014). Generates complex nested data with nonlinear interactions.|
| `nested_data_random`    | Following the setting used in [Gallego et al.(2024)](#Gallego2024). Generates random prices and utilities within user-defined ranges.|
| `nested_data_NewBounds` | Following the setting used in [Kunnumkal (2023)](#Kunnumkal2023). Creates complex nested structure data with smooth relationships between price and utility.|
| `nl_data_vi0_uniform01` | **Our extension** of `nested_data_NewBounds` introducing low within-nest no-purchase utility `vi0 ‚àº U(0, 1)`. |
| `nl_data_vi0_uniform34` | **Our extension** of `nested_data_NewBounds` introducing high within-nest no-purchase utility `vi0 ‚àº U(3, 4)`.  |
| `nl_data_vi0_lognormal` | **Our extension** of `nested_data_NewBounds` introducing long-tail distribution no-purchase utility `vi0 ‚àº LogNormal(Œº=1, œÉ=0.5)` clipped to [1, 5]. |

### 2. Constraint Generation
Here summarizes commonly used constraint generators for assortment optimization. Each function returns a pair `(A, B)` representing linear constraints of the form $Ax \leq B$, where $x$ is the binary assortment vector.

You can import them as:
```bash
from generator.constraints import *
```

| Function | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `cardinality`| Generates a cardinality constraint ensuring that at most `cap` products can be selected. |
| `card_nested_logit` | Only applicable to NL models. It restricts the maximum number `cap` of products within each nest. | 
| `cons_capacity` | Generates capacity constraints with different randomized structures. |

### 3. Heuristic Optimization Method
Here summarizes the optimization algorithms implemented in our framework.  

The following method is used to solve the MMNL model, you can import all heuristics as:
```bash
from heuristic.general_heuristic import *
from heuristic.mmnl_heuristic import *
```
| Function| Description |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Conic_mmnl_warm_start` | An exact method to find the globally optimal assortment by formulating the problem as the conic integer formulation. [≈ûen et al.(2018)](#≈ûen2018)|
| `revenue_order` | A simple heuristic that sorts products by price and selects all products with revenue greater than a threshold. [Talluri et al.(2004)](#Talluri2004)|

The following method is used to solve the NL model, you can import all heuristics as:
```bash
from heuristic.general_heuristic import *
from heuristic.nl_heuristic import *
```
| Function| Description |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `revenue_order_nl` | A algorithm based on linear programming, where each nest $i$ contains the $k_i$ highest-revenue products.[Davis et al.(2014)](#Davis2014)|
