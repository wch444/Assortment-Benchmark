# Hard Instances for Assortment Optimization under MMNL and NL Choice Models

This repository provides a dataset for the assortment optimization problems under two popular discrete choice models: the **Mixed Multinomial Logit (MMNL)** and **Nested Logit (NL)** choice models.  

This dataset provides hard instances we generated using a systematic approach (see our paper), and an accessible interface to test the performance of an algorithm designed by you. The code is designed for **reproducibility, extensibility, and comparability**.

## üìù Hard Instance Data
This `hard_data/` folder provides **pre-generated challenging instances** for benchmarking assortment optimization algorithms under both **Mixed Multinomial Logit (MMNL)** and **Nested Logit (NL)** choice models.

All instances is stored in JSON format and can be loaded directly using utility functions in `generator/utils.py`.

Below we describe how we generate and select these hard instances.

---

### 1. Instance Generation
- For MMNL model, the data is generated from the function `mmnl_data_v0_lognorm`
- For NL model, the data is generated from the function `nl_data_vi0_uniform01` and `'nl_data_vi0_uniform01`

---

### 2. Instance Selection

To ensure that the provided instances are genuinely **challenging and representative of difficult cases**, we followed a systematic selection process:

- **Initial Generation**: For each parameter combination (e.g., specific values of m, n, and cap_rate), we generated 100 candidate instances by controlling the random seed (seeds 1-100).

-  **Multi-Method Evaluation**: Each candidate was evaluated using multiple state-of-the-art algorithms, including:
   - Revenue-ordered heuristic [[Talluri et al. (2004)](#Talluri2004)„ÄÅ[Davis et al. (2014)](#Davis2014)]
   - ADXOpt algorithm [[Gallego et al. (2024b)](#Gallego2024b)]
   - AlphaPhi heuristic [[Gallego et al. (2024a)](#Gallego2024a)]
   - LP-based policy: [[Kunnumkal (2023)](#Kunnumkal2023)]
   - Our proposed neural network-based policy

- **Hard Instance Identification**: For each algorithm, we identified the five instances with  the largest optimality gap (greater than $10^{-4}$), representing the most challenging instances where the algorithms performed worst.

- **Union of Challenging Cases**: The union of all identified hard instances across all tested methods, ensuring that each instance is difficult for at least one (and often multiple)  method.

- **Final Dataset Composition**: The resulting hard instances in the `hard_data/` folder represent cases where existing methods struggle, making them ideal benchmarks for evaluating new algorithms.


**Optimal Solution Calculation**:
- **MMNL instances**: The optimal revenue is computed by solving the mixed-integer conic program formulation proposed by [≈ûen et al. (2018)](#≈ûen2018) using Gurobi. When Gurobi fails to find the exact optimal solution within a reasonable time limit, we use the best assortment found across all compared methods as the benchmark.
- **NL instances**: Due to the computational complexity of finding exact optimal solutions for large-scale NL problems, all methods are evaluated against the theoretical upper bound developed by [Kunnumkal (2023)](#Kunnumkal2023). This upper bound provides a performance guarantee for assessing solution quality.


**Key Statistics**:
- Each parameter combination typically contains 3-10 hard instances
- Instances are selected to maximize algorithmic difficulty rather than random sampling

**This selection methodology ensures that researchers can**:
- Test their algorithms on genuinely difficult problem instances
- Compare performance across multiple challenging scenarios
- Identify algorithmic weaknesses and opportunities for improvement

## üöÄ User Guide

The easiest way to get started is to run the example Jupyter notebooks located in the `src/` directory. Each notebook demonstrates how to load hard instances, implement your own algorithm, and evaluate its performance.

print(f"Problem size: m={data.m}, n={data.n}")
print(f"Optimal revenue: {data.max_rev:.4f}")

# Implement your method
assortment = your_algorithm(data)

# Evaluate
revenue_fn = get_revenue_function_mmnl(data)  # or get_revenue_function_nl
revenue = revenue_fn(assortment)[0]
gap = (data.max_rev - revenue) / data.max_rev * 100
print(f"Your gap: {gap:.2f}%")
```
